# New CSS style sheet on top of Moodle Template

On this project, I was tasked with creating a CSS style sheet to be applied on top of a Moodle Template. 

The main goal was to make the website available on the three major device formats: mobile, tablet & desktop.

As I could not have access to the server and the project at the time I had to use Firefox Dev Tools to understand the whole HTML / CSS architecture of the project and test the changes directly on the browser.

## Key Results

- Applied mobile-first CSS;
- Thoroughly documented/commented the project to be easily modified over time by other devs on the team;
- Guaranteed the whole website experience is available to be enjoyed on the three platforms;
- Brough the design of the website closer to the other website of the brand, diluting the major differences that previously existed.

  
## Key Challenges

- Not having access to the project was a major difficulty;
- Having to work on top of a Moodle Template limited the possible changes;
- Applying changes to the CSS by modifying the existing classes created some unexpected results;
- Not being able to see the whole project and changing it profoundly had me using !important more times than I wished for.
